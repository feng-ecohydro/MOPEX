The fractional spatial coverage of each of the 16 USDA soil type 
(12 soil, 4 other category) was compiled for each basin.  
The analysis used 1-km gridded maps of USDA soil texture class for 
each of 11 soil layers.  The 1km gridded data sets were produced by 
Miller (1999) based on STATSCO polygon representation of soil texture.  
Table 5 provides the USDA soil classification definitions.
